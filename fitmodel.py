class FitModel:
    ###This class should make it easier to add models together so you can fit your data with flexibility
    ###ported from matlab program "NMRD profiler" by Lionel Broche

        self.isFixed=[] #list of booleans, set to 1 if corresponding parameter is fixed, 0 if they are to be optimized
        self.minValue=[] #list of values, minimum values reachable for each parameter, put to -inf for no lower bound
        self.maxValue=[] #list of values, maximum values reachable for each parameter, put to inf for no upper bound

        self.bestValue=[] #list of values, estimate from fitting routine
        self.errorBar=[] #list with confidence intervals !!Note: bokeh doesn't support errorBar plots yet. so no need to be specific at the moment #TODO: come up with a good solution
        self.fitobj=object()#fitting object created after the model is used for fitting TODO: is object() OK in this context?
